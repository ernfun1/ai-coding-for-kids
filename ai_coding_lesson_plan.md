# 2-Hour AI Coding Introduction
*Target Audience: High school students with mixed tech experience*

## Overview
Students will learn to use AI as a coding partner to build a "Personality Quiz App" - a fun, interactive web application that gives personalized results based on user responses.

---

## Hour 1: AI Coding Foundations

### Opening (10 minutes)
**Hook Activity**: Show a completed version of the quiz app
- "By the end of today, you'll build this yourself using AI as your coding partner"
- Quick poll: "Who has coded before?" / "Who has used AI tools?"

### Segment 1: Meet Your AI Coding Partner (20 minutes)

**What is Claude Sonnet 4?**
- AI (Artificial Intelligence) assistant that understands and writes code
- Think of it as having a super-smart coding tutor available 24/7
- Works in your web browser - no downloads needed (PC and Mac friendly)



**Demo: First Interaction**
```
Try typing: "Hi! I'm new to coding. Can you explain what HTML is in simple terms?"
```

**Key Teaching Point**: AI responds to natural language - talk to it like a helpful person!

### Segment 2: Basic Coding Prompts (30 minutes)

**The Art of Asking AI for Code**

**Prompt Pattern 1: Be Specific**
```
Bad: "Make a website"
Good: "Create a simple HTML page with a blue background and a heading that says 'Welcome to My Site'"
```

**Hands-on Practice**: Students try both prompts and see the difference

**Prompt Pattern 2: Ask for Explanations**
```
"Create a button in HTML and explain what each part does"
```


**Student Practice Round** (10 minutes)
- Students experiment with different prompts
- Peer sharing: "What's the coolest thing it made for you?"

## Hour 2: Building the Personality Quiz App

### Segment 3: Project Planning (10 minutes)

**Our Goal**: Build a "What's Your Study Style?" quiz app

**Features we'll include:**
- Welcome page with app title
- 5 multiple-choice questions
- Personalized results based on answers
- Colorful, mobile-friendly design
- Fun animations/effects

**The AI Development Process:**
1. Start with basic structure
2. Add questions one by one
3. Create the scoring system
4. Make it look awesome
5. Add special effects

### Segment 4: Guided Building Session (40 minutes)

**Step 1: Foundation (8 minutes)**
```
Prompt: "Create an HTML page for a personality quiz called 'What's Your Study Style?'. For now, just include a welcome message, a start button, and make it look modern with CSS. Use colors that appeal to high school students. We'll add more functionality later"
```

*Teaching moment: Point out the HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity) in Claude's response*

**Step 2: Adding Questions (10 minutes)**
```
Prompt: "Add the first quiz question: 'When you have a big test coming up, you:' with 4 multiple choice options:
A) Make detailed study notes and flashcards
B) Study with friends in a group
C) Review everything the night before
D) Find videos and interactive content online
Make each option clickable."
```

**Step 3: Building the Full Quiz (10 minutes)**
```
Prompt: "Add 4 more questions about study habits, preferred learning times, organization style, and motivation. Keep the same 4-option format but vary the content. Use what you know about the psycology of learning where question A's describes an Organizer, B's Collaborator, C's Procrastinator, D's Digital Navite. 
```

**Step 4: Results System (10 minutes)**
```
Prompt: "Create a scoring system that tracks which letter (A, B, C, or D) the user picks most often, then shows a personalized result:
- Mostly A's: 'The Organizer' - detailed description
- Mostly B's: 'The Collaborator' - detailed description  
- Mostly C's: 'The Last-Minute Hero' - detailed description
- Mostly D's: 'The Digital Native' - detailed description
Include fun emojis and encouraging messages."
```

**Step 5: Polish and Effects (2 minutes)**
```
Prompt: "Add smooth transitions between questions, a progress bar, and make the results page more visually exciting with animations and better colors."
```

### Segment 5: Customization and Debugging (10 minutes)

**Make It Your Own:**
- Students modify colors, questions, or results
- Add personal touches (school name, inside jokes, etc.)

**Common Issues & AI Solutions:**
- "My button doesn't work" → Ask AI to debug
- "I want different colors" → Ask AI to modify CSS
- "Can you make it look more like TikTok/Instagram?" → Describe the style you want

**Sample debugging prompt:**
```
"My quiz isn't working properly. When I click an answer, nothing happens. Can you help me fix it and explain what went wrong?"
```

## Wrap-up and Next Steps (10 minutes)

### Show and Tell (5 minutes)
- Students share their quiz apps
- Highlight creative modifications
- Celebrate different approaches

### Key Takeaways (3 minutes)
- **AI is a powerful coding partner, not a replacement for learning**
- **Good prompts = better results** (be specific, ask for explanations)
- **Iteration is key** - build, test, improve, repeat
- **Don't be afraid to experiment and ask questions**

### Continue Your Journey (2 minutes)
**What's Next:**
- Practice with different types of apps (games, calculators, creative tools)
- Learn to read and modify the code AI creates
- Explore other programming languages (Python, JavaScript frameworks)
- Join coding communities and continue learning

## Teaching Notes

### For Mixed Experience Levels:
- **Beginners**: Focus on understanding prompts and seeing code work
- **Experienced**: Challenge them to modify Claude's code or ask for advanced features

### Technical Requirements:
- Reliable internet connection
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No software installation needed
- Works identically on PC and Mac

### Backup Plans:
- If AI is slow: Have pre-made code snippets ready
- If students finish early: Challenge them to add new features
- If someone gets stuck: Pair them with a peer or use it as a teaching moment

### Assessment Ideas:
- Can they successfully prompt AI to create code?
- Do they understand the basic structure of their app?
- Can they make simple modifications?
- Are they thinking about how to improve their prompts?

### Extension Activities:
- Create different quiz themes (movie preferences, career matcher, etc.)
- Add social sharing features
- Make the app mobile-responsive
- Connect multiple apps together
